This is the subdirectory that I recovered from Raghu's account on the
SGI Indigo work stations.  I made the stuff run on the SGI Origin of
the ATN.  There was one problem with a format statement which
apparently was not used.  I described my changes in the source code.
If I was wrong the String "RUBBISH" would appear sonmewhere in the
output file "pack.out" of the program "rnpack".

I tried to bring a little bit order into the files.  The source code
is now in the subdirectory "SOURCE" (formerly "pub").  I also created
a makefile that copies the executable file into the subdirectory
"EXEC".  The subdirectory "EXAMPLE" contains an example how to use the
code.  It assumes that the path also contains the EXEC directory.

Obviously there are still a lot of data files in this directory that
are mixed up with source code.  This is not nice but I will not remove
the data files now because some could be used to generate correlated
packings which I do not know how to do yet.  But in future no data
should be added to this subdirectory.
