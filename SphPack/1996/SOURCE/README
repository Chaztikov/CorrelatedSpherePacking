The rnpack has been modified, some parameters and subroutinea have been
changed to make it easier to use, the last modification was mede on
December 14.

To make the packing code work properly, the followings have to be met,

1.  The number of spheres in an initial packing should be greater than
10,000.

2.  To create a purely random packing, three files might be modified,
	 *  <packin.par>  should be changed to get the right sample size,
	 particle size distribution, and right final porosity.
	 *  <paramt> might be modified to make sure that all the arrays are
	 within the maximum array declarations.
		  nmax - the maximum number of spheres in the sample
		  ncmax - the maximum number of cells in each direction
		  icmax - the maximu number of spheres in each cell
	 *  <subdim.par> should be changed to extract a part of packing for
	 pore reconstruction or analysis of pore sample.
		 
3.  To build a spatially correlated packing, the following steps should
be taken,
    *  to run rnpack to get the domain size information, then to stop
	 the program.
	 *  to generate pfield, first to run sgsim to get a random field,
		 +  <sgsim.par> should be changed to get the right domain size
		 which should be exactly the same as the rnpack domain size output.
		 +  <sgsim.inc> might be modified to make sure that all the arrays
		 are within the maximum array declarations.
		 +  all the parameters are defined in GSLIB manual.
    *  to transform the sgsim output <sgsim.out> to uniform p-field, 
		 +  to run backtr,  input data include <unif.trn> and <sgsim.out>
		 +  the output <pfield.dat> should be checked to make sure the
		 uniformity, using histplt; to view it using plot1.
		 +  histplt and plot1 are the programs in GSLIB.
    *  to run rnpack again to obtain the final packing with spatial
	 correlation.

To calcutate the coordination number distribution for a sphere packing,

1.  to modify the cndist.f input subroutines to get the right format.

2.  to modify cnparam and cnparam.in.

3.  to run cndist.
	 
To calculate the spatial pore/solid indicator function,

1.  To make sure to have pack.out and pack.par ready.

2.  To modify the <pore.inc> to define the maximum dimension. 

3.  To modify <domain.par> to get the right extraction of the packing.

4.  To run poredat to get <pore.par> and <pore.out>.

To get the right input for AVS visualization of pore samples,

1.  To modify <avsdim.par> to get the position.

2.  To run avspore to get <avspore.out>.


The pore network code has been started, it is called network.c.
